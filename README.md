# Sendra

The Sendra engine has been created by Alexis Cosano Rodr√≠guez as a college's project.
This release aims to be a 3D model viewer, which can load models with more than one mesh, but only one texture at a time.
Here are the controls:

- Pressing F focus the camera on the current model loaded.
- Left Alt + Left Mouse Button orbitates around the object.
- WASD + Right Mouse Button lets you use a FPS like camera.
- SHIFT makes the camera move faster.
- You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel.
- CTRL + S saves some of the Engine's configurations and CTRL + L loads them up.
- You can dock windows by dragging them on top of each other.

- You can drag and drop models and textures.
(But bear in mind that only one model and one texture can be displayed at a time)


On the main menu bar there are some options that will help you test and learn more about the engine.



# Known issues

Loading after saving during the first time opening of the executable, will cause it to open up some windows that should
not open at that point in time. If you want to avoid this, open the executable for the first time, save, and close it.
After opening it again, it should work fine. (Note: this is not necessary, if you load and have all the windows open, you
can just close them through the main menu bar. It's just lest tedious.)
